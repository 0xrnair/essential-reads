This is what we can do with the datetime and time modules in Python

    import time
    import datetime

    print "Time in seconds since the epoch: %s" %time.time()
    print "Current date and time: " , datetime.datetime.now()
    print "Or like this: " ,datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%y-%m-%d-%H-%M")


    print "Current year: ", datetime.date.today().strftime("%Y")
    print "Month of year: ", datetime.date.today().strftime("%B")
    print "Week number of the year: ", datetime.date.today().strftime("%W")
    print "Weekday of the week: ", datetime.date.today().strftime("%w")
    print "Day of year: ", datetime.date.today().strftime("%j")
    print "Day of the month : ", datetime.date.today().strftime("%d")
    print "Day of week: ", datetime.date.today().strftime("%A")

That will print out something like this:

    Time in seconds since the epoch:    1349271346.46
    Current date and time:              2012-10-03 15:35:46.461491
    Or like this:                       12-10-03-15-35
    Current year:                       2012
    Month of year:                      October
    Week number of the year:            40
    Weekday of the week:                3
    Day of year:                        277
    Day of the month :                  03
    Day of week:                        Wednesday
